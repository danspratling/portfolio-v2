Outdated websites can be harmful to your businesses bottom line. It doesn't matter if you're a billion dollar business, small local company or solo freelancer; an ecommerce company, SaaS, nonprofit or something else. Your website is going to be the first place your customers start their purchase journey so it's important to get it right.

But your business isn't static, it changes and grows over time and that means you'll be changing your website too. Making content updates, adding blog posts and improving functionality. With your business so reliant on your website, it's important that it's working effectively for everyone, from your customers to your team.

The more you've invested in your website, the less likely you are to want to start over.

But as technology moves forward and our businesses grow sometimes we find solutions that once worked are now limiting us going forwards. The longer a website goes without updates, the more important a rebuild becomes but eventually every website will need one.

Your website will probably need a rebuild if it's failing in one of 3 areas: if your users are struggling to use your site effectively, if your editors are struggling to add and update content, or if your developers are struggling to make code changes.

## Simplify your marketing workflow

Your marketing team are constantly releasing new content and making updates to older content (or they should be) and it's important to make their job as easy as possible. Whether you're creating campaigns for different holidays or are regularly writing blogs for SEO impact, you need an excellent editing experience.

### Developing your brand

As your site grows, so does your brand. Over time you will probably find that your brand messaging doesn't match, especially when comparing newer content to something that hasn't been updated in years.

It may not just be content that you feel you've outgrown, but your entire brand image too. It's only natural for your design to reflect your values and how you your customers to percieve you.

When this happens you'll find that your website will need a significant change. That will probably mean a rebuild.

### Changing your audience

As your company grows you may also find that your audience changes. It's quite common for businesses to target larger businesses as they grow, but you could be releasing a new luxury product or have found that your product was targeting the wrong audience from the start.

Whatever your issue, a change in audience is a common problem that often prompts a redesign. Now you need to update your content and maybe even branding to focus on your new target audience.

### Improving your editor experience

As your team grows and your content strategy matures you'll find that you need to edit content more. That means a team of content writers and editors with ways for them to quickly get content out on the website.

If your team is struggling to add new products, write blog posts or just make changes to existing content on the website it's likely your Content Management System is holding you back (if you have one!).

It's important to choose the right CMS for your needs. There's a lot of great options out there and you'll want to select an option that matches your favoured workflow.

[Rebuilding your website with a new headless CMS](https://www.notion.so/Custom-Backend-Integrations-30c5819832cf473db23eb700c94af07b?pvs=21) that best suits the needs of your team will significantly improve how your team interact with your website, saving your team time when adding and updating content.

## Improving User Experience

[Your users are the center of your business](https://www.notion.so/The-ROI-of-UX-why-continually-improving-UX-is-good-for-business-b25268954da1439eae12584cdad6ef33?pvs=21) so it's important to make sure that their needs are being fulfilled. What that means to you will be different depending on your customers, your target market and how you want to be perceived. Your customers experience is always going to be a key part of your online strategy so it’s important to get it right.

### Redesign your customer experience

[Your customers are the core of your business](https://www.notion.so/UX-DX-CX-How-experience-is-a-core-component-for-your-website-s-long-term-success-c100ee35e13a4c6186faddae47d20e14?pvs=21) so it’s important to help them get what they need out of your website. Whether you’re selling products, offering a service or providing information, your customers experience starts with your website.

So if your finding that most of your customers are ignoring your website, or failing to reach their goals it’s time to take a look at what you could do to fix that.

Often, a redesign of your customer facing website will provide a fresh look and feel, enticing customers to engage more with your website.

[When we help improve the UX of our clients websites and apps](https://www.notion.so/UX-UI-Design-650a75e9f55b4c56829bcb95a49e87cf?pvs=21), we find it’s also a great opportunity to research what their users are primarily trying to do and use that knowledge to provide a better solution.

### Make your website faster

We’ve all run into websites that load slowly. Whether you’re waiting for images to load or running into delays loading every page you’ll know it’s frustrating. Your users will feel the same way, so it’s important to make sure your entire website loads as quickly as possible.

If you have a global business targeting many different countries it’s even more important to achieve higher speeds as some countries still have relatively poor internet connections, rely on 3G, or are just further from a dedicated infrastructure.

There are many reasons why performance bottlenecks can build up, but if your website is fighting with slow speeds then it’s important to fix it or your customers will find a competitor they don’t have to wait to load.

Our preferred solution is to work with the [Jamstack](https://www.notion.so/What-is-the-Jamstack-c49add84b1154a468839470e417b095e?pvs=21) which removes a lot of the performance issues you might usually run into but regardless of your approach, rebuilding your website while ensuring your website is fast will substantially improve its performance.

### Not forgetting about mobile

Yes, I know it’s 2021 so you’d be forgiven for thinking that every website worked on mobile but you might (or might not) be surprised to hear that there are loads of websites out there that still don’t work on mobile!

Mobile is more important than ever. With more people owning mobile phones than desktop computers, and around 60% of website traffic coming from phones, it’s important to make the most of your mobile visitors.

Google knows how important mobile is too. Last year Google switched to mobile first search analysis, which means that if your site isn’t responsive, you won’t get nearly as much search traffic (even on desktop).

Rebuilding your site and focusing on your mobile users will give you a huge advantage over the competition and make your customers much happier.

## Make development easier

If you want to make changes to your website, it’s likely that the main thing preventing you from doing this is the the difficulty of adjusting your technological approach. Development is expensive, but it doesn’t have to be a barrier for making changes. Revisiting your approach to development and making improvements to make it easier for your technical team can make a substantial improvement on the growth of your website

### Upgrading from outdated technologies

One of the biggest things holding back technological growth in companies is hanging on to outdated tech. This doesn’t necessarily mean that old technology is bad, but change happens fast and it can be very easy to fall behind, missing out on all the benefits brought forward by the modern web.

In the last 5 years, we’ve seen front end libraries enable Single Page Applications and mature to provide better performance with frameworks like Nextjs, Gatsby, Nuxt and Sveltekit. Backend technology has advanced a lot too, with edge computing and functions becoming the standard for the web allowing more complex control to happen away from your core web code.

For your website to continue to grow in the fastest, but also most flexible way, [utilising the Jamstack is critical](https://www.notion.so/Why-you-should-choose-Jamstack-87f7b6aa848c4677b6237f52baf93bab?pvs=21). By separating your technologies into their individual concerns, it allows your business to focus on improvements in a single area. This kind of specialisation makes it easier to deliver better results. It also makes it easier for different parts of your software to talk to each other.

You can see this phenomenon happening across the web. Ecommerce website are being powered by more and more specialist tools, with static websites, powered by shopify and taking payments from stripe - all different services linked together through the Jamstack.

By switching to modern technologies, you allow your developers to focus on the areas they’re good at, reducing mistakes and delivering better results.

### Reducing technical debt

It’s no secret that most companies have [technical debt](https://www.notion.so/Understanding-Technical-Debt-How-we-help-enterprise-reduce-tech-debt-ea8676c5b36542038893edf62cff91a4?pvs=21) of some kind. We often make compromises to allow features to be delivered on time or on budget. Sometimes this debt can show up as bugs. Other times, it prevents us from making changes easily or adding functionality as quickly as we’d like. Once debt builds up, it can be hard to get rid of.

If you’re struggling to make code changes because of technical debt that’s built up, sometimes it’s easier to wipe the slate clean and start over. But when you do this, it’s important to make sure you’re setting yourself up for success. The last thing you want to do after rebuilding is have to have the same thing happen again in a year.

It’s important to take steps to ensure your process provides the support needed for your developers to do the best job, and set your code up for future success. This often means allowing more time for changes up front, to reduce the time updates will need in the long run.

Adding in automated tests into your workflow to ensure code changes always function correctly, even in future updates. Building these into your workflow can help provide a better review process, by clearly showing if something isn’t working as expected (even visually), which helps the reviewer do a better job but also trains your developers to work in a more effective way and thinking about the long term effects of their changes.

Creating a seamless process amongst the team can also help streamline changes in the future, by helping designers, project managers, and other stakeholders understand how developers work best so you can continue to get the best results.

### Adding new functionality

Making changes to your website is hard enough. A successful company needs the ability to change their website with relative ease and adapt to new approaches the business wants to take. This often requires adding new functionality to your website, from help centres, docs pages, testimonials and more.

So when it comes time to make changes, you want the ability to pick the approach that works best for you. Working with vendors like Wordpress can seem like a quick and easy option up front, but when you’re locked into their plugin ecosystem you might regret not taking a more flexible approach.

We recommend Jamstack websites specifically because of their flexibility. Separating concerns means it’s very easy to add new functionality where you need it, whether that be a store, a payment provider, or something else. If it exists you can probably use it with relative ease.

Mobile apps are a great example of why Jamstack can help your business to quickly adapt to new opportunities and are popular with both SaaS and ECommerce businesses. Having your data in a single place and accessible from multiple sources means that when you update your product, your app and website both sync automatically. Apps are a pretty new concept (relative to the web), and having your data set up in a Jamstack way would make creating an app a whole lot easier.

Setting yourself up to take advantage of emerging technologies or adapt to your business needs as you grow might mean you need to make significant changes now. The good news is that making these changes puts you in a great position in other areas too, making technical development significantly easier across your entire business.

## What are the risks?

Completely overhauling your entire website isn’t risk free, despite the advantages that can come from making such a shift. The good news, is that these risks are fairly easily mitigated with the right approach.

Rebuilding your website is often not the cheapest option, but as we’ve discussed above there are many reasons you might want to do it, many which actually end up saving you a significant amount of money, and more importantly time, in the long term.

So when you do rebuild your website, here’s what to look out for:

### Losing SEO value

With any website rebuild you’ll find that your ranking on Google is at risk. You’re making a significant overhaul to your website, which means it’ll need to be re-crawled and re-indexed.

A few things to pay attention for

- Are you deleting lots of old, but maybe impactful pages?
- Are you correctly redirecting unused pages?
- If you’ve moved domain entirely, are you correctly redirecting from your old domain in every instance?
- Are you providing all the SEO tags google and social platforms need?

It may sound like a lot of work to make sure that all these things are correctly updated, and it is. But the advantages you could gain are going to be significant.

### Losing loyal customers

It’s a well known fact that people don’t like change, and that includes your customers. Even going from a super outdated design to a modern one with much better UX can put off loyal customers because of the shock of the change. That’s not to say you shouldn’t make those changes if you think they’ll give your customers a better experience, but you might need to temper how much you change in one go.

If you’re looking to make a significant overhaul to your application, and also want to keep your customers happy it’s important to make sure that you ease them into the new design. You’ll often see this with updated branding on services like Google Docs, where significant changes often allow customers to continue using the old version of your software for a while. This helps ease them into the new designs, allowing them to compare differences between the two while also getting used to the idea that the older version won’t be around forever.

### Never releasing the new website

One of the other problems of making significant changes to your website is that it’s very easy to find new features to add when you know you’re going to be changing everything anyway. And adding new features that benefit your customers is a great approach to take, but it can also add significant complexity to the project and make it harder to reach a point where launch is possible.

When releasing a new build, it’s important to focus on what’s essential for the initial release. That might be a lot, and that’s okay if that’s what you need and you plan around that. But it could also be a couple of pages (we launched the first version of the Skyward website with just one page).

There’s nothing stopping you from adding more features later.

## How to effectively switch between builds

Our recommended approach when you’re looking to rebuild your website is to break it down.

Build your MVP

This is the bare minimum you need to get your new website up and working and allow you to add content. What this looks like depends on your business

Then add the next most important feature, and the next, and keep going from there.

Approaching your project like this helps you prioritise what’s important while ensuring youdon’t get hung up in an extremely long release cycle.

For some projects, your MVP might be huge, especially if you’re replacing a large website that already exists, and that’s okay. For others, the job might appear huge, but can actually be completed relatively easily from a build perspective, and just need time to migrate content. An eCommerce store with lots of products is a great example of this.

One of the benefits of the Jamstack is that it can work alongside your current technology while you’re moving everything across. Maybe your landing pages start out using a new Jamstack approach, then your products (while you migrate them all across), then everything else. Or you could migrate all your marketing pages to Jamstack, leaving your SaaS product until you can rebuild that too. It’s incredibly flexible, and we can help you to find the right approach if you need help.

## Conclusion

So I’m sure I’ve done a great job of convincing you that you _should_ rebuild your website. If it’s old, outdated, and causing you lots of headaches then you probably do need to rebuild it! There’s lots of reasons why rebuilding your website is probably a good idea.

But our ethos is that you shouldn’t have to rebuild your website from the ground up very often, or at all. A good architecture will allow you to make small (or even large) changes over time and we encourage everyone we work with to set themselves up in a well structured way that lets them easily do that, without causing bigger problems down the line.

We do this by understanding the business needs of our customers, helping to form a good understanding between designers, developers, and the rest of the team in how features should be put together in the most effective way for the long term. We don’t just want you to have a good website now, but put you in the best position to have a good website in 5 years time.

And remember. You don’t have to do it all in one go - in fact, we encourage you not to! Make smaller changes and improve continuously.
