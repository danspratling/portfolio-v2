Dan is one of those rare people who can do it all and at an incredibly high standard. He'll leading a multi-faceted team, bring designs to life, tackle complex UX problems, jump into the design trenches, and coordinate directly with clients, all without breaking a sweat.

His ability to interpret and build designs as accurate, performant code is second to none. He can do this with minimal oversight and without overly complex or stuffy documentation. It all feels second nature to him.

His processes, communication, and overall can-do attitude are also fantastic, culminating in end products that tick all the boxes. Dan's a fantastic addition to any ambitious, high-achieving team.
