One of the hardest questions you will ask yourself when you hire a team to build your website is, ‚Äú_how much should I actually pay for a website?‚Äù_

Your website is an incredibly valuable part of your business so you want to be sure to get your new site build right.

**_You get what you pay for_**

But at the same time, you probably have a budget (or maybe that‚Äôs why you‚Äôre here), a timeline, and want to get as much bang for your buck as you can.

## How much does a marketing website cost

There‚Äôs a lot of complexity when it comes to creating a website (we‚Äôll talk about this in a minute), and all those factors are taken into account when deciding upon how much partners should charge.

Let‚Äôs mull over the figures for a second, and then talk about why there is _so much variance_

|            | Template - Freelancer | Custom Build - Freelancer | Template - Agency | Custom Build - Agency |          |
| ---------- | --------------------- | ------------------------- | ----------------- | --------------------- | -------- |
| Small      | 0-10 pages            | $500+                     | $3000+            | $5000+                | $20,000+ |
| Medium     | 10-100 pages          | $3000+                    | $10,000+          | $15,000+              | $30,000+ |
| Large      | 100-1000 pages        | $10,000+                  | $25,000+          | $30,000+              | $50,000+ |
| Enterprise | n/a                   | $50,000+                  | n/a               | $100,000+             |          |

Experience and skills come at a cost, but when created well will always provide more value than the total cost of the project.

After all, a website is an _investment in your business‚Äôs future._

By that logic, spending more can seem lucrative but your actual budget is going to be the biggest guiding factor.

Note that we‚Äôre talking about the up front cost of outsourcing a website here. This doesn‚Äôt include month-to-month costs like hosting, CMS, uptime monitoring, or long-term support and maintenance

Lots of the variety shown in the table above can be attributed to differences in skills or services offered.

There‚Äôs a few key things to note‚Ä¶

## The key differences

Your requirements can completely change the scope of a a project and that means that the best partner to help you could entirely change too.

Having a good understanding of your needs will help you to pick the best team to support you.

### Freelancer or Agency

When deciding on whether you should hire a freelancer or an agency for your project, it‚Äôs important to know where their strengths and weaknesses lie.

**Freelancers**

- Tend to focus only on one or two specific skills
- Typically focus on smaller scope projects

**Agencies**

- Often cover lots of skillsets
- Can handle much larger scope projects
- But are often more expensive.

But, agencies and freelancers can also have a lot of variation between each teams workflow too.

As always, it‚Äôs important to find what works for you.

### Custom Builds or Templates

If you‚Äôre looking to find a partner to build a marketing website, docs site, or eCommerce store then one of biggest things to consider is how customised you‚Äôd like your site to be.

**Templates**

- Great for getting started quickly
- Relatively cheap

**Custom Builds**

- Much more flexible
- Ability to future-proof
- Efficiently built
- Improved maintainability

Again, there can be some overlap depending on the quality of the team you‚Äôre working with to build your site so make sure you strongly consider what you need and how you want to do it.

### Design, Development, and more

Sometimes when you‚Äôre looking for external help you‚Äôre looking for a single skill that your team doesn‚Äôt have. Other times, you‚Äôre looking for a complete solution to be built.

Many different freelancers and agencies are built around providing a very specific set of services to help fill gaps that your team might have.

Other teams might be full-service solutions that focus on providing everything you need around creating a specific type of website.

Your needs will depend on your project so it‚Äôs always good to do your research.

## Why should I pay more?

There are a lot of things to take into consideration when hiring an external team to build or update your site, and each team will have different talents and specialisms so it‚Äôs important to do your research.

Typically, pricing will depend on how experienced a team is, how specialised your solution needs to be, and the quality of the final result.

### Experience

If you‚Äôre hiring an external team to build your website it is _probably_ because you don‚Äôt have the resources to do it yourself.

You could build a website yourself if you really wanted. Webflow, Wix, Wordpress and Squarespace offer the ability to design and build websites without hiring anyone if you wanted.

What you‚Äôre paying for, however, is the experience that someone (or many people) with years of experience can provide.

Experts can help you understand what works, what doesn‚Äôt, and what‚Äôs the best way to approach ideas.

### Quality

With experience also comes better quality. Specialists in a platform, tools or skillset learn better ways to enhance their services.

Agencies and freelancers are building websites all the time, and are regularly challenging their own approaches with different clients. That can give them a variety

That means a greater understanding of user experience, better UI designs, and improved code that‚Äôs easier to maintain long term, and much more.

### Services & Solutions

One of the biggest differences between teams is the variety of services and solutions they offer. Some are highly focused one one specific skill, others focus on a specific outcome, while others are all-rounders.

Your needs will obviously vary depending on the kind of project you‚Äôre enquiring about and the value you‚Äôll attribute to that project. Whether you need a skill like UX design, a solution like a headless marketing website, or a more general all round support will change how businesses might charge for their support.

## What do you need?

Possibly the biggest consideration before hiring an external team is ensuring that they _can actually deliver what you‚Äôre looking for._

Pricing here will typically be tied what output it is you‚Äôre looking for, with more challenging projects often costing more, but are also more likely to provide better results.

### Size

How many pages are you after? The difference between creating a 10 page website and 1000 page website is obviously going to be substantially different.

The more pages you create, the more time you‚Äôll have to put in to build them.

Highly skilled teams will be building _systems_ that allow you to create and maintain thousands of pages easily.

### Complexity

Not all websites are made from landing pages, and as the needs of your site start to increase so does the complexity. Whether you‚Äôre going multi-language, adding a checkout or going all out and building a custom SaaS interface, you‚Äôre going to be adding complexity to your site.

Complex functionality makes sites harder to create and harder to maintain, but they can also make you stand out by providing better experiences for your team or customers so the trade-off is often worth it.

Talented teams will make complex functionality in a way that‚Äôs as simple as possible, making complex functionality feel simple.

### Quality

One of the biggest things that can make your website stand our is the care and attention you put into it.

High quality websites are something that‚Äôs felt by customers, providing a better experience that helps to ensure repeat visitors, and can even generate virality or awards helping you gain even more traffic.

Expert teams can help with their vast knowledge and completed projects allowing you to bring onboard skills that your internal team doesn‚Äôt have, providing you with a much higher quality solution than you could deliver on your own.

## Important observations

**Websites can start pretty cheap, and get very expensive**

And there‚Äôs a good reason for that. If you‚Äôre spending money on a website and especially if you‚Äôre hiring somebody else to help you with that, you‚Äôre almost certainly looking at a business use case.

And as a business, your website is going to be making you money (if it‚Äôs not, why have it?). But the size and reach of your business impacts how much money your website can make. And if your website is likely to make a lot of money, you‚Äôre probably going to want to spend a good amount of money to make sure that you‚Äôre getting your website right.

**Agencies have higher costs than freelancers**

Which seems like an obvious thing to state, but it‚Äôs true. Freelancers only have to worry about themselves but agencies have teams to support and business expenses to account for which can be clearly seen when comparing agencies lowest pricing to freelancers lowest pricing clearly shows the difference.

But it‚Äôs also interesting to note that while freelancers do tend to be cheaper than agencies, the gap does narrow pretty quickly as solutions get more complicated, because the value of the solution is high regardless of who‚Äôs creating it.

**There‚Äôs no upper cap**

Every single price listed is only a starting price.

I‚Äôve seen small, custom Webflow sites created by freelancers sell for $25,000+ because they provide huge value to the business, so even though the starting price is $3,000 for that bracket there is a _huge_ amount of possible variation, even within one designated group.

So it‚Äôs important to keep in mind that this is a _guide_, not a rule for how all freelancers and agencies price their work.

## Conclusion

The main takeaway is that website prices can vary wildly. Small projects can be priced fairly low but depending on complexity the price can grow exponentially.

If large, complex websites are out of your budget it‚Äôs important to remember that, depending on your business needs, you might not need to spend that much.

Websites are an investment, so it‚Äôs important to find a balance between what you can afford, and where you‚Äôre hoping to be.

And always do your research to make sure you‚Äôre getting exactly what you need.
