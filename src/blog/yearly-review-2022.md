Skyward has officially turned 1 ü•≥, and this year has been a rollercoaster. We‚Äôve had some great months working on amazing projects and we‚Äôve also had some not-so-good months (it can‚Äôt always be perfect I suppose!) but even despite that this year has been incredible.

I‚Äôve grown a lot, and learned a lot, and through all the ups and downs I‚Äôve been able to hyper-focus on exactly where I want to take Skyward, going from a growth focused agency into a more personal one. I still, of course, plan to grow the agency and the team behind it in the future, but only when it‚Äôs (and I‚Äôm) good and ready to do so.

I wanted to share the progress we‚Äôd made and the direction I plan on taking Skyward in the future. I‚Äôve always been very open about how Skyward runs so this will be a totally transparent look at what we‚Äôve done, some of the decisions I‚Äôve made, and how successful they‚Äôve been (everyone loves to talk money, don‚Äôt they?).

# What we‚Äôve done

## Skyward website relaunch

I‚Äôve been thinking hard about the direction we want to take Skyward and the old website wasn‚Äôt doing our work justice.

There were a few things I wanted to improve on

- Very technical sales approach ‚Üí Refocus on our UX roots
- Complex ‚Äúflashy‚Äù features ‚Üí Easy updating for everyone on the team
- Unclear brand image, bland & corporate ‚Üí Become a professional, yet personal brand

Essentially, we wanted the website to better reflect who we are, what we do, and the values we bring across.

Of course, being busy meant that this kept getting pushed back, which is why it took over 6 months to release. Whoops! üòÖ

Going forward we‚Äôll be continuing to update this site with more relevant content, talk more about the work we do and the results we provide.

## Pigeon Loans

At this point I‚Äôve been working with Pigeon Loans on and off since I started freelancing in 2020 and have helped them grow from an idea into a thriving and in-demand platform with over 20k users (and counting).

This year we helped Brian and the team redesign their application, refreshing the UI and dramatically improving the user experience to help make peer-to-peer lending safer and easier for everyone.

In the past few months, they‚Äôve successfully achieved Y Combinator Alumni Status, as well as over $2.5m in additional funding. An amazing achievement, and I expect they‚Äôll continue to top it going forward!

## Other projects

We always aim to deliver the best results and sometimes that takes a long time. Some of our projects have been going on for a while, and we‚Äôll be certain to share once they‚Äôre ready!

Here‚Äôs a sneak peek:

# Finances

### Income & Expenses

| Date | Revenue | Costs | Profit |
| Q3 2021 | $57,600 | $50,500 | $7,100 |
| Q4 2021 | $33,800 | $32,000| $1,800 |
| Q1 2022 | $51,500 | $35,000| $16,500 |
| Q2 2022 | $74,000 | $69,000| $5,000 |

I‚Äôve learned a lot about how to (or how not to) manage money in this year, but overall it‚Äôs been a great year. Every quarter has been profitable and each quarter has also earned a significant amount of revenue!

With that in mind, you can clearly see that most months aren‚Äôt left with much breathing room, with Q4 2021 being scarily close to making a loss (not as bad as actually making a loss though), and Q1 2022 only being so profitable by pushing costs to a later quarter - a strategy that could have easily backfired. Costs have grown a LOT more than revenue since the previous year - this makes sense as I switched from freelancing and hired/contracted more.

Even so - it has been an excellent first year of business, but there‚Äôs a lot of room for improvement!

(Keep in mind, these numbers are counting my own pay as costs too - this shows money left after each month, but does not take into account tax which happens after the end of the first year)

### Going Profit First

Profit first is a model where you take all your income and break it out into profit, expenses & owners pay & tax. Then limiting yourself to only spending what‚Äôs in your expenses & owners pay pots.

By breaking your income down this way, you‚Äôre encouraged to only spend what‚Äôs in pots allocated for spending, and therefore always ending the year with profit, and slowly optimising the efficiency of your business. It‚Äôs like a sealed piggy bank - you can‚Äôt open it without smashing it, or at least that‚Äôs the idea.

That‚Äôs obviously a very simple version of how this works, if you‚Äôre interested in reading deeper I‚Äôd highly recommend reading the entire book (it‚Äôs a really good read) [UK] [US].

I haven‚Äôt been very good at this this year. There have been unexpected expenses and difficult projects that required more investment than originally planned - but regardless of this being able to use the profit pot to pay for this has meant we‚Äôve always had a buffer when things get hard. It‚Äôs how we‚Äôve always stayed profitable overall, even in the bad months.

Next year, the plan will be to build this pot out so we can take more profit at the end of the year, hopefully leading to bonuses, and giving us a bigger buffer in the event of problems that might arise.

# Fully transparent

One thing I‚Äôve always thought while working at agencies in the past is ‚Äúwhy are they hiding their processes?‚Äù. The ways we work shouldn‚Äôt be secret, or only used to impress our clients when it means we‚Äôre about to win work (aka: make some money). One thing I‚Äôve found since working for myself is that there‚Äôs plenty of work to go around. So let‚Äôs help bring everyone up while we‚Äôre at it!

### Designs

Want to take a look at our design process for Skyward? Have a look at our Figma files and see exactly how we work and what we‚Äôre working on, including how we break down our components and showcase our work to clients.

### Testing

We love testing our components, and while it may not be very common to see lots of testing in the front-end space (at least not as much as _I‚Äôd like_), we think there are lots of situations where testing is incredibly useful. Whether testing Snapshots, Interactions or End-to-End, we always encourage testing, especially as your project starts go get larger and uptime becomes more critical.

We‚Äôll be demoing how we test some of our projects in an upcoming blog post, so make sure you sign up to the newsletter so you don‚Äôt miss that!

### Statistics

Wanna see how well the Skyward website is _actually_ doing? What was our best (or worst) month? Where does our traffic come from? How has it changed over time?

We draw tons of interesting insights from analytics for our clients and ourselves on a regular basis, and as a brand new agency we want to include you in the journey and show you exactly what this rollercoaster is like!

# Doing our part

Skyward may not be a huge business after just one year, but that doesn‚Äôt mean we can‚Äôt start giving back! We hope to see this list (and the funding we can provide) grow over time.

### Carbon Offsetting

Going forward we‚Äôll be offsetting our carbon use to ensure we‚Äôre doing our part. We‚Äôve already started offsetting 200% of the carbon our full time team uses while working _and_ while not working (yep, we‚Äôre carbon positive!). We decided to use Wren to offset our carbon which allows us to easily calculate how much carbon our team uses, and contribute to a variety of projects to help alleviate that!

(Join Wren and help the planet)[link]

We also considered offsetting the carbon used to create our websites, but our static websites are so carbon efficient, we‚Äôd only need to plant one tree per year! It‚Äôs still good to keep an eye on your sites though, especially as they get more complex and more visitors.

### Supporting developers

We‚Äôve also started sponsoring FreeCodeCamp, an amazing and totally free learning platform for developers starting their career in tech. I‚Äôve been supporting them on Twitter for a while, so it feels great to be able to be able to sponsor them too!

# Lessons learned

## It‚Äôs not all about growth

A lot of people see endless growth as the goal of their business. Growth is impressive, and looks good on reports (or on Twitter) but I‚Äôve found that growth for the sake of bigger figures is hard work, and potentially damaging long term.

This year I nearly tripled growth (from $60k freelancing to $200k at Skyward) but that also meant increased stress, higher costs and extra responsibilities. That‚Äôs not to say I don‚Äôt want to keep growing Skyward (I definitely do!), but I‚Äôve learned that I have to be much smarter about it. More isn‚Äôt always the answer, especially if that means a lot more costs too.

### Ups and downs will always balance out

There will always be high and low points in business, but if you stay on your toes and keep looking for things that can be improved, you can always turn things around.

And if you keep doing that over time, things will continue to improve. Skyward is extremely new when it comes to business so some mistakes are expected to be made. My goal is to always keep things going in the right direction, and if (or more likely, when) mistakes happen, we learn from them!

# Next year goals

[Financial Goals](https://www.notion.so/10fe9fe2945c4d73bdcf2c0c08dbeffb?pvs=21)

Profit is calculated after paying my own salary - this is not technically counted by most accountants (or tax calculations) but it is a fixed cost of business, so I account for it in these figures like any other employee/freelancer might be. Profit is also calculated before tax and as this is our first year, we haven‚Äôt had a tax bill yet!

The financial goals next year is consistency. Last year shows a lot of ups and downs, especially when you look at a monthly graph.

Ups are great, downs not so much. I want the income and costs of business to be more stable and predictable, and while viewing this on a quarterly basis helps smooth this graph out, you can see that Q4 and Q2 were very high cost, regardless of how much income was made.

Being more consistent means being able to be more profitable, which makes the business more secure in the event of any issues, or allows us to be more proactive with our growth, hiring in areas that benefit the business, instead of hiring reactively when we get busy as I have done mainly this year.

## Lifestyle goals

One of the core elements that drove me to create Skyward was the freedom to work on what I‚Äôd like, when I‚Äôd like. That was why I initally went freelance too.

While not every job is going to be perfect, I have mostly been able to work on what I‚Äôd like in the ways I‚Äôd like.

This is no small feat, especially while growing the business, hiring others, and making a profit.

But there are still improvements that we could make.

The first is keeping my work hours below 32 per week. I‚Äôve recently reduced my working hours to try and improve my work-life balance. This has meant a much better sleep schedule! But I would love to be able to get to a point where I am consistently able to keep to only working 4 days (32h) per week or less.

I also need to better manage my capabilities. It‚Äôs very easy to get overwhelmed as a Designer/Developer/Leader/Founder, especially as teams and workloads start to grow. Finding a good balance between growth for the business, without adding extra stress is incredibly important for the continued success of the business. This requires me knowing my limits, what I can delegate, and how best to do that - or turning more work down if it‚Äôs not something we can effectively fit into our schedules.

## It‚Äôs still amazing progress

I have to be honest, when I went freelance 2 years ago, I never expected to be running a small agency and even though there have been ups and downs, I‚Äôve learned so much, gained so much experience and made so many new friends.

In only 2 years I‚Äôve gone from being ‚Äújust a developer‚Äù to a founder running a UX-focused Jamstack agency, and I‚Äôm incredibly proud of what my team and I have been able to achieve. I can‚Äôt wait to see what‚Äôs next.
